# Seismic Events Analyzer

## Context

There are actually quite few sources from which we can fetch seismic data (RESIF, IRIS or even local data from NAS server). So the main issue is to be able to manipulate data from different sources and different formats. Indeed, we may want to use data from RESIF in parallel to data from local server.

So, a possible solution is to develop algorithms able to manage data from different sources and to fetch signals data and sensor type for each desired station in the world.

To develop this project, I'll use several existing APIs from different sources, but, before to use them, I have to establish a kind of simple documentation presenting essentials useful data and their real-world signification.
